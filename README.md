# Restorent
Hi,
The project is created within the constraints of no DB and no client side so the user interface is in input and output commands and the data is initialized within the program.
The program is initialized when the restaurant is empty of customers, when there are no customers there is no work for the waiters and chefs.
Each customer who enters selects a table and dishes from the menu, after he finishes selecting his list of dishes moves to the general list of dishes of the specific table
At the end of the selection of dishes the customer is asked if there are more customers at the table who are interested in ordering dishes, if not, the list of dishes at the table is sorted by preparation time from high to low and the specific table enters the queue from which the waiter takes the dishes to chefs.
A chef is available to get an order if he does not have a dish or the time for preparing the order he had is over, in the last case the order must first be transferred to the table and the final price presented and then another order can be transferred to the chef.
